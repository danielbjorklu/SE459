TODO:

Scoring is buggy after refactoring.  Someone needs to go through and fix it.
Events located in the tracking package need to be finished.  Wasn't able to get to it.
QuestionManager needs to be updated to allow for random questions.  Some code exists but isn't fully implemented.
Player and Team Managers need to be refined.
GameManager has been refactored, but could use some more.  Took a while to get the hints to where they are.
JSON folder needs actual questions on Agile methodologies.
Need testing for everything.
There are some comments in the code that point to things that need to be updated, though not everywhere.
I'm sure I'm missing something.  Everyone needs to review what I've done and make updates where necessary.
It's not a finished product, but it's pretty close.
